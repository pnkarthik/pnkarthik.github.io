The setting comprises two sets of arms, the source and target arms, whose means are unknown but related through a known <em>linear</em> transfer function. By sampling and collecting observations from the source arms, the goal is to <em>transfer</em> (or harness) the information acquired from the source arms to infer the best target arm with the least expected stopping time, subject to an upper bound on the error probability. For this problem, we present the first-known asymptotic lower bound on the growth rate of the expected stopping time, where the asymptotics pertain to the fact that the  error probabilities vanish. This growth rate is captured by a sup-inf optimisation whose optimal (sup-attaining) solution is potentially non-unique and hence challenging to track asymptotically. Inspired by the analytical techniques of <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/7212a6567c8a6c513f33b858d868ff80-Abstract.html" target="_blank"  rel="noopener noreferrer">Jedra and Proutiere (2020)</a>, we provide a tracking-based algorithm that is improvised to handle potentially non-unique optimal solutions.

The TPMs are unknown to a decision entity that wishes to find the index of the odd arm as quickly as possible, subject to an upper bound on the error probability. We derive a problem instance-specific asymptotic lower bound on the expected time required to find the odd arm index, where the asymptotics is as the error probability vanishes. Further, we devise a policy based on the principle of certainty equivalence, and demonstrate that under a continuous selection assumption and a certain regularity assumption on the TPMs, the policy achieves the lower bound arbitrarily closely. Thus, while the lower bound is shown for all problem instances, the upper bound is shown only for those problem instances satisfying the continuous selection and the regularity assumptions.

We use the travel times on the BPL corridor as a measure of the effectiveness of the BPL. We find that there is a significant improvement in the travel times after the introduction of the BPL; for the worst 10% of the travel times, we find an improvement between 4% and 28%. Our methodology involves extracting trips on the BPL and computing the travel times for these trips from a time series of GPS information. Our methodology is scalable and can be used to compute the travel times between any two given points in other similar studies. We supplement our results with a novel test (called the D-test) for comparing the levels of stressful driving in the following scenarios: (a) morning peak hours (IST 07:00 hrs to 11:00 hrs) versus evening peak hours (IST 17:00 hrs to 21:00 hrs), and (b) northward trips versus southward trips on the BPL. We are able to infer that the drivers are generally more stressed during the morning peak hours and during the southward trips on the BPL. Partitioning the BPL into segments, we show that a majority of the segments exhibit similar effectiveness and driver stress trends as the full BPL stretch.

A decision maker, who knows these transition probability matrices, wishes to identify the odd arm as quickly as possible, while keeping the probability of decision error small. To do so, the decision maker collects observations from the arms by pulling the arms in a sequential manner, one at each discrete time instant. However, the decision maker has a trembling hand, and the arm that is actually pulled at any given time differs, with a small probability, from the one he intended to pull. The observation at any given time is the arm that is actually pulled and its current state. The Markov processes of the unobserved arms continue to evolve. This makes the arms restless. For the above setting, we derive the first known asymptotic lower bound on the expected time required to identify the odd arm, where the asymptotics is of vanishing error probability. The continued evolution of each arm adds a new dimension to the problem, leading to a family of Markov decision problems (MDPs) on a countable state space. We then stitch together certain parameterised solutions to these MDPs and obtain a sequence of strategies whose expected times to identify the odd arm come arbitrarily close to the lower bound in the regime of vanishing error probability.

Each client is associated with a multi-armed bandit in which each arm yields <em>i.i.d.</em> rewards following a Gaussian distribution with an unknown mean and known variance. The set of arms is assumed to be the same at all the  clients. We define two notions of best arm$-$local and global. The local best arm at a client is the arm with the largest mean among the arms local to the client, whereas the global best arm is the arm with the largest  average mean across all the clients. We assume that each client can only observe the rewards from its local arms  and thereby estimate its local best arm. The clients communicate with a central server on  uplinks that entail a cost of $C\\ge0$ units per usage per uplink. The global best arm is estimated at the server. The goal is to identify the local best arms and the global best arm with minimal total cost, defined as the sum of the total number of arm selections at all the clients and the total communication cost, subject to an upper bound on the error probability. We propose a novel algorithm $\\textsc{FedElim}$  that is based on successive elimination and communicates only in exponential time steps, and obtain a high probability  instance-dependent upper bound on its total cost. The key takeaway from our paper is that for any $C\\geq 0$ and error probabilities sufficiently small, the total number of arm selections (resp. the total cost) under $\\textsc{FedElim}$ is at most $2$ (resp. $3$) times the maximum total number of arm selections under its variant that communicates in every time step. Additionally, we show that the latter is optimal in expectation up to a constant factor, thereby demonstrating that communication is almost cost-free in $\\textsc{FedElim}$.

Also known as odd arm identification, this problem falls within the class of optimal stopping problems in decision theory and can be embedded within the framework of active sequential hypothesis testing. Prior works on odd arm identification dealt with independent and identically distributed observations from each arm. We provide the first known extension to the case of Markov observations from each arm. Our analysis and results are in the asymptotic regime of vanishing error probability."),r.a.createElement("p",null,"We associate with each arm an ergodic discrete time Markov process that evolves on a common, finite state space. The notion of anomaly is that the transition probability matrix (TPM) of the Markov process of one of the arms (the odd arm) is some $P_1$, and that of each non-odd arm is a different $P_2$, $P_2 \\neq P_1$. A learning agent whose goal it is to find the odd arm samples the arms sequentially, one at any given time, and observes the state of the Markov process of the sampled arm. The Markov processes of the unobserved arms may either remain frozen at their last observed states until their next sampling instant (rested arms) or continue to undergo state evolution (restless arms). The TPMs $P_1$ and $P_2$ may be known to the learning agent beforehand or unknown. We analyse the following cases: (a) rested arms with TPMs unknown, (b) restless arms with TPMs known, and (c) restless arms with TPMs unknown. For each of these cases, we first present an asymptotic lower bound on the growth rate of the expected time required to find the odd arm, and subsequently devise a sequential arm selection policy which we show achieves the lower bound and is therefore asymptotically optimal."),r.a.createElement("p",null,"A key ingredient in our analysis of the setting of rested arms is the observation that for the Markov process of each arm, the long term fraction of entries into a state is equal to the long term fraction of exits from the state (global balance). When the arms are restless, it is necessary for the learning agent to keep track of the time since each arm was last sampled (arm\u2019s delay) and the state of each arm when it was last sampled (arm\u2019s last observed state). We show that the arm delays and the last observed states form a controlled Markov process which is ergodic under any stationary arm selection policy that picks each arm with a strictly positive probability. Our approach of considering the delays and the last observed states of all the arms jointly offers a global perspective of the arms and serves as a \u2018lift\u2019 from the local perspective of dealing with the delay and the last observed state of each arm separately, one that is suggested by the prior works. Lastly, when the TPMs are unknown and have to be estimated along the way, it is important to ensure that the estimates converge almost surely to their true values asymptotically, i.e., the system is identifiable. We show identifiability follows from the ergodic theorem in the rested case, and provide sufficient conditions for it in the restless case."))))))),r.a.createElement(w,{heading:r.a.createElement(r.a.Fragment,null,r.a.createElement("span",null,"Journal"),r.a.createElement("span",null,"Publications")),data:y.journals,getBadgeColor:m}),r.a.createElement(w,{heading:r.a.createElement(r.a.Fragment,null,r.a.createElement("span",null,"Conference"),r.a.createElement("span",null,"Publications")),data:y.conferencePublications,getBadgeColor:m}))))},N=t(17),E=function(){return
