              I am a research fellow at the <a href="https://ids.nus.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Institute of Data Science</a> of the <a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National University of Singapore</a> (NUS),
              where I work with <a href="https://vyftan.github.io/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Vincent Y. F. Tan.</a> Prior to joining NUS, I was a research associate in the <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of ECE</a> at the <a href="https://iisc.ac.in" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore,</a> where I worked with <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~rajeshs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Rajesh Sundaresan</a>.
              I was fortunate to have Prof. Rajesh as also my PhD supervisor. My PhD thesis was titled <a href="https://karthikpn.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/main.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sequential Controlled Sensing to Detect an Anomalous Process</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="infoSection m-0">
              My research interests are in the areas of information theory, statistical learning theory, detection and estimation theory, and information geometry.

              Between August 2014 and July 2015, I was a project assistant in Prof. <a href="https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~cmurthy/doku.php?id=home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chandra R. Murthy</a>â€˜s lab, where I worked on some aspects of target localisation.
              It was during this stint at IISc that I got introduced to the world of research and got motivated to pursue PhD studies. I am truly grateful to Chandra for nurturing the seed that would later germinate and embrace the wonderful world that research is.
              I graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Communications from <a href="https://rvce.edu.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rashtreeya Vidyalaya College of Engineering</a> in 2014.

              I love to travel the world and learn about the different cultures that mankind has come to know over the years. I have an intense passion for teaching. I also possess a keen interest in Carnatic classical music in its slow-paced form that places emphasis on bringing out the right mood ingrained with the lyrics.
