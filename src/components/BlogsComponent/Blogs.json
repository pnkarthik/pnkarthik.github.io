    "initialContent": "If you are wondering what is special about the number 1756, the answer is, well, nothing. It is definitely not one of those magical Ramanujan numbers; it is close to the infamous 1729, but still 27 away from it. At breakfast today, the 23rd of May 2020, my father started to casually chat with me about what research meant, how a novice Ph.D. student would set foot in the arena of research in the backdrop of many skilled players that had played, some still playing, with little to no spectators to cheer, how a novice Ph.D. student went about discovering new ideas, etc.",
