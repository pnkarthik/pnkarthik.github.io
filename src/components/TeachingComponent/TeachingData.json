      "courseDescription": "This course offers a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of programming in Python, tailored for students embarking on their journey into AI and ML. Throughout the course, students will gain hands-on experience by implementing essential AI/ML tasks from scratch. The curriculum provides an in-depth exploration of fundamental Python data types, functions, loops, conditional statements, tuples, lists, and dictionaries. Additionally, students will be exposed to the powerful libraries in Python such as Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, equipping them with the tools necessary for sophisticated data analysis and visualization. As part of the exercise sets, students will engage in practical data analysis using real-world datasets from neuroscience, and implement core AI/ML tasks, including the training of artificial neural networks (ANNs), backpropagation, $k$-means clustering, and $k$-nearest neighbor classification, all from scratch. The course is designed to facilitate students who intend to pursue projects in deep learning and/or reinforcement learning in their subsequent semesters.",
