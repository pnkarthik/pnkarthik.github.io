      "courseDescription": "This course offers a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of programming in Python, tailored for students embarking on their journey into AI and ML. Throughout the course, students will gain hands-on experience by implementing essential AI/ML tasks from scratch. The curriculum provides an in-depth exploration of fundamental Python data types, functions, loops, conditional statements, tuples, lists, and dictionaries. Additionally, students will be exposed to the powerful libraries in Python such as Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, equipping them with the tools necessary for sophisticated data analysis and visualization. As part of the exercise sets, students will engage in practical data analysis using real-world datasets from neuroscience, and implement core AI/ML tasks, including the training of artificial neural networks (ANNs), backpropagation, $k$-means clustering, and $k$-nearest neighbor classification, all from scratch. The course is designed to facilitate students who intend to pursue projects in deep learning and/or reinforcement learning in their subsequent semesters.",

Beginning with a rigorous treatment of the various notions of convergence of sequences of random variables, the course will touch upon the topics of stationary and wide-sense stationary processes, Bernoulli and Poisson processes, and stopping times. The heart of the course comprises a thorough and detailed exposition of the theory of discrete-time Markov chains on finite state spaces, introducing the students to the notions of irreducibility, recurrence, period, invariant distributions, and the ergodic theorem. Alongside providing theoretical foundations, the course will also provide a deep dive into simulation techniques such as importance sampling and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques.",
